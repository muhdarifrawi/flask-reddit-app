# Project Motivation
A project using PRAW to list out r/NonZeroDay

## Prerequisites
IDE used:
- Visual Studio Code (VSC)

The following must be installed:
- Python
- Flask
- python-dotenv

## Preface
Running Python on VSC was a challenge for me. One thing I severely learned was that you can't choose 'Debug current Python file' and expect dotenv to run together. I couldn't figure out how to use virtualenv so instead I ran Flask instead. Which worked.
